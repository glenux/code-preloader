I would like to replace the hardcoded structure of the output "@@ ... " with a jinja template that would be handler with the crinja.cr shard.

My strategy is to preload the content during process_file and store it in a hash.
Then the hash will be used in the end to render a final template (from crinja).

Can you please tell me :
* where the changes should occur (which file? which class? which method?)
* what kind of changes must be made there?

Please do not write code yet, simply explain.
