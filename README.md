# Code-Preloader

Code-Preloader is a specialized tool designed to streamline the process of
working on coding projects with interactive large language models (LLM) like
ChatGPT, Claude, Mixtral 8x7B, etc. 

It preloads and concatenates files from a specified directory, allowing for the
seamless integration of customized prompts. 

This tool is ideal for those who seek an alternative to tools like GitHub
Copilot, enabling a tailored interaction with your favorite LLM.

## Features

* Preload and concatenate files from a given directory.
* Customizable header and footer prompts for your LLM.
* Simple command-line interface for easy operation.

## Limitations

**Note:** This tool is optimized for smaller codebases. For larger
repositories, performance may not be optimal due to processing constraints and
the nature of interactions with LLMs.

## Prerequisites

Before installing and using Code-Preloader, make sure your system meets the
following requirements:

1. **Crystal Language**: Code-Preloader is written in Crystal. Ensure you have
   the Crystal programming language installed on your system. For installation
   instructions, refer to the [official Crystal language
   website](https://crystal-lang.org/install/).

2. **Required Libraries**: The following libraries are necessary for the proper
   functioning of Code-Preloader:
   * `libevent`: Used for asynchronous event notification.
   * `libyaml`: Required for YAML parsing.
   * `libmagic`: Utilized for file type detection.
   * `make`: Used to define compilation rules

On a Debian-based system, you can install these libraries using the following
command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libyaml-dev libmagic-dev make
```

## Installation

To get started with Code-Preloader, ensure that you have the prerequisites
installed on your system (see above).

Then follow these steps to install:

```bash
git clone https://code.apps.glenux.net/glenux/code-preloader
cd code-preloader
make prepare
make build
make install
```

## Usage

### Packing directory content

Run Code-Preloader with the following command-line options:

```
Usage: code-preloader pack [options] DIR ...

Global options:
    --version                        Show version
    -h, --help                       Show this help

Pack options:
    -i REGEXP, --ignore=REGEXP       Ignore file or directory
    -o FILE, --output=FILE           Write output to FILE
    -H FILE, --header-prompt=FILE    Load header prompt from FILE
    -F FILE, --footer-prompt=FILE    Load footer prompt from FILE
    -c FILE, --config=FILE           Load parameters from FILE
```

#### Basic Use Case

To preload all files in the `src` directory and output to `result.txt`, while
ignoring the `git` the `bin` directory, and the result file itself:

```bash
./bin/code-preloader pack -o result.txt -i .git -i result.txt -i bin/ src
```

#### Advanced Use Case

To preload all files in the `src` directory and output to clipboard, prepending
and appending prompts, while ignoring the `git` the `bin` directory, and the
result file itself:

```bash
./bin/code-preloader pack \
    -i .git -i bin/ -i result.txt -i prompts \
    -H prompts/context.txt -F prompts/request-readme.txt \
    src \
    | ctrlc
```

__Note__ `ctrlc` is my alias to `xclip -selection clipboard -i`

### Using a config file

You can automatically create an empty configuratio file by running
Code-Preloader with the following command-line options:

```
Usage: code-preloader init [options]

Global options:
    --version                        Show version
    -h, --help                       Show this help

Init options:
    -c FILE, --config=FILE           Load parameters from FILE
```

#### Example: Advanced with configuration file

Given the following configuration file (ex: `code_preloader.yml`).

```yaml
---
ignore_list:
  - .git
  - code_preloader.yml
  - bin
  - prompts

output_file_path: null
header_prompt_file_path: prompts/context.txt
footer_prompt_file_path: prompts/request-readme.txt
```

You can type a shorter command like:

```bash
./bin/code-preloader -c code_preloader.yml src | ctrlc
```

__Note__ `ctrlc` is my alias to `xclip -selection clipboard -i`
