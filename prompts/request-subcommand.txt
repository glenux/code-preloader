@@REQUEST

I would like to change CLI parameters structure add add two subcommands:
* init : which will create an example .code_preloader.yml file (with comments)
* pack : which will create the packed version of the current directory for LLM prompting

Most of current options (except --version and --help) must become options of the pack subcommand.

I already started some changes to achieve this goal, but it is not finished, and I need your help and expert advises.

Can you please tell me :
* where the changes should occur (which File? which Class? and which method?)
* what kind of changes must be made there?

Please do not write code yet, simply explain.
